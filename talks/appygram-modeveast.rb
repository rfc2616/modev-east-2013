  Appygram provides a smart back end for
  feedback features you build into your
  native mobile app.

  It stores a rolling buffer of recent
  messages, and forwards messages on to
  the services you specify.

  ** ADVANCED **

  Appygram also collects and forwards
  App Store and Google Play reviews

  *** SUPER ADVANCED ***

  Appygram can create and route alerts
  about unusual or exceptional conditions
  detected by automated systems.
EOS

block <<-EOS
  Like ...

  - huh, we're getting a lot of exceptions
  - something expected stopped happening
EOS

block <<-EOS
  SPOILERS!

  Where it really gets interesting is
  when we can correlate the two. Users are
  writing in with problems AND some
  monitored conditions are outside of
  normal parameters.

  Appygram is free for personal accounts.

  Just go to \e[1mwww.appygram.com\e[0m to sign up.

  The "freegan" plan will get you going.
EOS

block <<-EOS
  What you don't get as a freegan:

  - Lots and lots of distinct apps
  - Ability to email third parties
  - Ability to delegate access to your apps
    to "watchers"
EOS

block <<-EOS
  What everybody gets on any plan:

  - High availability SSL backend
    compatible with all major mobile devices
  - Fully configurable webhook and email
    forwarders
EOS

block <<-EOS
  Coming down the road

  - Support for web-based feedback forms
